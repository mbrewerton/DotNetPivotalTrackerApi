    <releaseNotes>
      Features:
      - Added the ability to get stories in the Icebox
      - Added the ability to get stories in the Backlog
      - Added the ability to get stories in My Work for either the current user (by default) or by initials is passed as a query string
      - Added the ability to search stories using a search query string. Currently, this must match the query string rules of Pivotal Tracker search exactly.
        - Note: Future release will provide a way to make this method easier to use without needing to provide a full query string. Suggestions welcomed.

    <summary>
      The package is in no way near feature-complete. There will be many new versions and builds in the coming months as features get added and will remain in Alpha until I am satisfied that a decent majority of most-used features are included in the build.

      If you have any requests on features that should be implented as a priority, head over to the GitHub page (https://github.com/mbrewerton/DotNetPivotalTrackerApi) and raise an Issue there.</summary>
