## About
The .NET Wrapper for Pivotal Tracker API is a .NET wrapper to enable easy use of the Pivotal Tracker REST API. It is current compatible with .NET4.5 and UAP10.0 applications.

**Note: There have been breaking changes in version 1.1.0-Alpha. If you are currently using the package, please be aware of the changes. The changes are noted in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/mbrewerton/DotNetPivotalTrackerApi#release-notes).**

You can access the nuget package here: [Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mbrewerton.DotNetPivotalTrackerApi).

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to the project via Pull Requests (PRs), but all PRs must be created against the `develop` branch. Contribution branches would preferably be created using gitflow - Create a branch called `feature/your_feature_to_add` from `develop` and then create a PR for `feature/your_feature_to_add` -> `develop`. If you are picking off an item in the TODO list, please include the item name in the description section of your PR.

## Quickstart Guide
To start using the API, create a new PivotalTracker instance `PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker(YourApiToken)` and you can use all methods in the package from that instance. You can have multiple instances at once with multiple API keys if needed:
``` C#
PivotalTracker personalTracker = new PivotalTracker(PersonalApiKey);
PivotalTracker businessTracker = new PivotalTracker(BusinessApiKey);
```

If you don't wish to expose your API token, or you have anoher requirement that means you need to use credential authorisation, you can do so by using the `AuthorizeAsync` method.
``` C#
PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker();
await tracker.AuthorizeAsync("Username", "Password");
```

## Examples

### Types of Authentication
You can authenticate in two ways: API Token or user credentials. Here's an example using an API token:
``` C#
// This tracker is already authenticated and can start calling the REST API immediately
PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker("MyApiToken");
```

In order to authenticate using credentials, you need to instantiate your tracker instance slightly differently:
``` C#
// Note the use of the default constructor. We don't want to pass a token here!
PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker();
// If the `AuthorizeAsync` call succeeds, your `tracker` instance is now authenticated
await tracker.AuthorizeAsync("myusername", "mypassword");

// If you want to use AuthorizeAsync in a non-async method, you can use .Result. Your authenticated user will be returned if successful.
PivotalUser authUser = tracker.AuthorizeAsync("myusername", "mypassword").Result;
```
tl;dr on how the new authentication mode works: It authenticates with Pivotal Tracker using the credentials entered, then if successful it will grab the API Token for the user and use that for subsequent requests. The client using the credentials is disposed as it's not needed.

### Get User Info
You can use the API to get your user data as well as specific REST actions:
``` C#
PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker(_apiKey_);

PivotalUser user = await tracker.GetUserAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"User Info: {user.Name} ({user.Initials}) has username {user.Username} and Email {user.Email}");
```
All methods return an object, including any POST or PUT methods. This means you can use previously created objects when making subsequent calls. DELETE requests will return a boolean, returning `true` if it was successful. If there was an error, a `PivotalHttpException` will be thrown allowing you to try/catch for it. The exception message will include the full error message from Pivtotal Tracker.

### Creating a New Story
``` C#
PivotalTracker tracker = new PivotalTracker(_apiKey_);
int projectId = 1357;

// Create a new story with c'tor
PivotalStory savedStory = await tracker.CreateNewStoryAsync(projectId, "My new Feature", StoryType.feature, null, "My description");

// Create a new story with a pre-made object
PivotalStory myBug = new PivotalStory
{
  Name = "My new story",
  Description = "My new description",
  StoryType = Enums.StoryType.bug.ToString(),
  Labels = new List<string>
  {
      "My label"
  }
}
PivotalStory savedBug = await tracker.CreateNewStoryAsync(projectId, myBug);
```

### Adding a Task to a Story
``` C#
int projectId = 1357;
PivotalStory story = await tracker.GetProjectStoriesAsync(projectId).First();
PivotalTask storyTask = await tracker.CreateNewStoryTaskAsync(projectId, story.Id, "This is a task");
```

## Release Notes

### 1.2.0-Alpha
- Added the ability to get stories in the Icebox
- Added the ability to get stories in the Backlog
- Added the ability to get stories in My Work for either the current user (by default) or by initials is passed as a query string
- Added the ability to search stories using a search query string. Currently, this must match the query string rules of Pivotal Tracker search exactly.
  - Note: Future release will provide a way to make this method easier to use without needing to provide a full query string. Suggestions welcomed.

### 1.1.1-Alpha
- Fixed ability to create new stories
- Fixed ability to add comments to stories
- Fixed memory leak from unclosed FileStream when uploading files to comments

### 1.1.0-Alpha
- **[Breaking Change]** Removed the "PivotalNew" models. All methods (Get and Create) now use the same model
- **[Breaking Change]** Refactored public PivotalTracker methods to be async
  - All methods have been renamed to include the `Async` suffix. Eg: `GetProjects()` => `GetProjectsAsync()`
- Added authorisation for username/password authentication
  - see the [Authentication Section](https://github.com/mbrewerton/DotNetPivotalTrackerApi#types-of-authentication)
- Fixed credential authorisation hanging in Portable C# applications

### 1.0.6-Alpha
- Added authorisation for username/password authentication
  - see the [Authentication Section](https://github.com/mbrewerton/DotNetPivotalTrackerApi#types-of-authentication)

### 1.0.4-Alpha
- Fixed previously broken build
- Included support for UAP applications in addition to regular .NET 4.5 applications
  - This uses the same namespace (`DotNetPivotalTrackerApi`) unlike the previous "Portable" build

### ~~1.0.3-Alpha1~~
~~- Package is now compatible with UWP/UAP10 projects by referencing the `DotNetPivotalTrackerApi.Portable` namespace~~

### 1.0.1-Alpha2
- Added the ability to persist a Project Id to a PivotalTracker instance by passing as a parameter
- Fixed HttpClient conflicts when using multiple PivotalTracker instances at once

### 1.0.1-Alpha1
- Add GetUserInfo method to Examples
- Add GetProjects method to Examples
- Add CreateNewStory method to Examples

### 1.0.1-Alpha
- Add examples project to the solution

### 1.0.0-Alpha
- Initial development release
- Features are limited to Get, Update, Delete stories, comments and tasks
- Comments handle file attachments

## TODO
This TODO list is not in any prioritised order, it is basically a dumping ground for the next features that I am planning to work on. If you wish to contribute, check out the [Contribution](https://github.com/mbrewerton/DotNetPivotalTrackerApi#contribution) section.

- Make methods truly Async with syncronous counterparts to provide async flexiblity
- Create a custom HttpHandler for the HttpClient to provide Unit Testability
- Provide the ability to chain methods using fluent syntax
- Implement project statistics such as velocity
- Provide GET/POST/PUT/DELETE functionality for Epics
- Eventually cover all PT endpoints... Give a dev a chance!
